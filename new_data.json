		"Recursion",
		"Recursion, data structures, for loops, conditionals, etc. in Python",
		"Programming basics, data structures, functions, recursion",

		"I learnt the basics of python programming, linux and how to navigate through github."
	],
	"Describe how aspects of this course (lectures, discussions, labs, assignments, etc.) contributed to your learning.": [
		"The lectures were continuous such that we would essentially pick up where we left off so I was able to easily pick up new concepts and link them to the ones we already learned.",
		"The homeworks were difficult but made me understand how to work with the concept much better.",
		"Homework and midterm were the right level of challenge",
		"The lectures allowed me to learn both theoretical concepts and their practical applications",
		"The discussion sections allowed me to learn how to collaborate with classmates on problems",
		"Professor Ng's lectures are clear and helpful to understand the concepts. Great practices in discussion. Assignment is harder than lecture but fairly manageable.",
		"Lectures were useful for understanding basic theory of new material, but discussion sections, where we were given similar problems and worked through them, helped to really understand how to solve each week's assignment. Office hours were most useful for understanding our problems or where we are confused. However, changing the system around midway through the quarter to a waiting room where only one student can talk to a TA at a time made progress substantially slower.",
		"Homework was relevant and fun to complete. You can see that this is one of the most well–organized courses at UChicago, with coherent homework, lectures, and discussion sections. Code quality feedback from TAs was nice to have. I appreciate the TAs for spending so much time reading the messy codes I write.",
		"I found assignments to be the most useful in my studies. Specifically the Project assignments.",
		"Classes are kind of iffy and fast paced. The homework is where things are really absorbed for me",
		"Lectures were pretty good but not 100% necessary, assignments were hard as hell, discussion sections were mostly useless but occasionally priceless",
		"Working with friends on homework and projects was the most important part of learning from the class",
		"Lectures were very informative and helpful",
		"The lectures were very interesting with Prof Ng. Was especially helpful that he had lecture notes, learned mostly through those.",
		"Lectures were not that helpful in the moment – the textbook and lecture notes were definitely more helpful. Homeworks forced me to internalize the concepts I learned, and discussions gave good practice problems I could discuss with other people and reference later on as well.",
		"Discussions are helpful",
		"The lectures and Professor Ng's corresponding notes were very thorough and easy to follow, helping me to retain the material. Spencer's discussions were very informative and helped get me accustomed to the \"be–a–computer\" problems.",
		"Class notes posted online by Professor Ng as well as the textbook were the most helpful resource besides going to office hours.",
		"I didn't go to class but the assignments were not bad",
		"The lectures taught me the functions to use in python. The discussion sessions taught how to interpret and approach \"be–a–computer\" problems."
	],
	"Additional comments about the course:": [
		"Many people, including me, did not like the grading structure really well, as for the homework, getting two needs improvements will lock one from getting an A, which we thought is counterproductive, as once people know they won't get an A, their will drop their effort to A– at best.",
		"Code \"completeness\" (= whether it runs properly) is weighted equally with code \"quality\" (= aesthetic judgements about how you wrote it), which I didn't love",
		"The course went pretty quickly like we would jump from typical functions to classes. I think if we had more time to cover trees and recursion in more detail, i would like that. Discussion was not as helpful but also just the grouping of students I did not enjoy bc some students would know more than others (which is great), but would not slow down / help the other understand.",
		"Very intense workload, but I felt that what I was learning was meaningful and useful. I overall enjoyed learning Python in this course, but it came with a lot of work (more work than any other class I've had at UChicago).",
		"I thoroughly enjoyed this course and think my coding skills improved vastly because of it!",
		"I was not a beginner to CS, so the class was alright. However, I do think it will be pretty hard for people with no background CS experience at all.",
		"As a beginner of this course, this course poorly taught me how to approach computer science as the homework and projects were unrealistically challenging. Although the rigour of this course is heightened by the quarter system, this course does not teach python to beginners well. There should be leeway in this course, for homeworks and assignments, to let beginners explore and learn computer science at a more manageable pace."

	"Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": [
		"He was open to and often encouraged questions and those questions were very helpful in understanding more about the data structures or other concepts taught in class.",
		"Lectures",
		"Office hours",
		"Being very open and understanding to students' questions",
		"leading us through concepts and problems",
		"He was very straightforward on what we would see, and how we would be able to deal with them in a general sense.",
		"Professor Ng's lecture notes posted online were helpful. He is very logical and straightforward with his teaching.",
		"Nothing.",
		"Examples and clear definitions.",
		"Lectures",
		"Notes and lectures",
		"I liked how clear he was in explaining how to use the methods we learned syntactically.",
		"I appreciated Professor Ng's lecture notes (posted online) – they were helpful because often I didn't understand what was happening in class.",
		"Professor Ng was very good about explaining the theory behind different concepts and illustrating examples both through IPython and on the chalkboard. He also welcomed questions and gave very helpful answers.",
		"Professor Ng had really clear and organized notes posted to his website, these were great especially considering it could be hard to see the board in class or if you missed something in lecture.",
		"Teaching us how to write and interpret basic python functions."
	],
	"What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
		"I would have liked more about CS theory rather than just python stuff that we could have learned on YouTube",
		"record the lectures",
		"The instructor could discuss examples in class that are more closely related to the problems assigned that week.",
		"I think Professor Ng asked too many questions in class. It sometimes dragged the lecture's pace down and made it boring.",
		"Make on the screen more visible.",
		"",
		"Be less engaged in communicating with the class and rather just deliver information non–stop. Otherwise, the same questions get asked every class and we spend time unproductively.",
		"Rebalance lecture time to spend more time on harder subjects and less on easier ones.",
		"As extensive as the API for our assignments was, edge cases were regularly omitted from assignment descriptions and you had to instead go into the auto–grader code to find which weird edge cases your code was failing. Might've liked more transparent expectations for our code up front",
		"(To all the instructors):",
		"Please provide a more organized office hour structure throughout the quarter.",
		"",
		"Additionally, I believe that the code quality standards were too high and penalized people for small mistakes that could in turn have a huge effect on what their grade could be.",
		"",
		"Overall, I don't think that having more than one un–Satisfactory score (out of 2 per each homework and 4 for each project) should completely eliminate someone's chance of getting an A in this class, because that sends the message that what you're looking for is an experienced coder in your class which is supposed to be targeted to beginners.",
		"Nothing to change!",
		"Instead of teaching beginners how to write code perfectly, there could be some space to let beginners learn programming by using more basic and 'messier' code to approach assignments."
