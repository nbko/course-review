                                <blockquote>This three-quarter sequence teaches
                                    computational thinking and skills to
                                    students who are majoring in the sciences,
                                    mathematics, and economics. Lectures cover
                                    topics in (1) programming, such as
                                    recursion, abstract data types, and
                                    processing data; (2) computer science, such
                                    as clustering methods, event-driven
                                    simulation, and theory of computation; and
                                    to a lesser extent (3) numerical
                                    computation, such as approximating functions
                                    and their derivatives and integrals, solving
                                    systems of linear equations, and simple
                                    Monte Carlo techniques. Applications from a
                                    wide variety of fields serve both as
                                    examples in lectures and as the basis for
                                    programming assignments. In recent
                                    offerings, students have written programs to
                                    evaluate betting strategies, determine the
                                    number of machines needed at a polling
                                    place, and predict the size of extinct
                                    marsupials. Students learn Java, Python, R
                                    and C++.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote>This three-quarter sequence teaches
                                    computational thinking and skills to
                                    students who are majoring in the sciences,
                                    mathematics, and economics. Lectures cover
                                    topics in (1) programming, such as
                                    recursion, abstract data types, and
                                    processing data; (2) computer science, such
                                    as clustering methods, event-driven
                                    simulation, and theory of computation; and
                                    to a lesser extent (3) numerical
                                    computation, such as approximating functions
                                    and their derivatives and integrals, solving
                                    systems of linear equations, and simple
                                    Monte Carlo techniques. Applications from a
                                    wide variety of fields serve both as
                                    examples in lectures and as the basis for
                                    programming assignments. In recent
                                    offerings, students have written programs to
                                    evaluate betting strategies, determine the
                                    number of machines needed at a polling
                                    place, and predict the size of extinct
                                    marsupials. Students learn Java, Python, R
                                    and C++.</blockquote>

                                    approach based on operational semantics to
                                    give clear and precise descriptions of
                                    language concepts, such as flow of control,
                                    data structures and types, modularity and
                                    abstraction, and concurrency. The major
                                    paradigms of imperative, functional, and
                                    object-oriented paradigms will be covered,
                                    starting with the functional paradigm
                                    because of its simplicity. Programming
                                    exercises in Standard ML will help make the
                                    formal concepts more concrete.</blockquote>

                                    outputs, and computations that effect

                                    their machines. In this course, we will
                                    enrich our perspective about these two
                                    related but distinct mechanisms, by studying

                                    include: algebraic datatypes, an elegant
                                    language for describing and manipulating
                                    domain-specific data; higher-order functions

                                    for abstracting programs; and a core set of
                                    type classes, with strong connections to
                                    category theory, that serve as a

                                    two main uses. They allow us to prove
                                    properties of our programs, thereby
                                    guaranteeing that our code is free of
                                    software errors. They also allow us to
                                    formalize mathematics, stating and proving

                                    systems, with a focus on applications of
                                    machine learning to computer systems. Topics
                                    covered will include applications of machine
                                    learning models to security, performance
                                    analysis, and prediction problems in
                                    systems; data preparation, feature

                                    environmental impact, and the productive and

                                    can be taken to reduce it. The objective of
                                    this course is to expose students to a
                                    sophisticated view of how computing affects
                                    the environment, and how it can become more

                                    engagement), and game design so that
                                    students can design and build an educational
                                    learning application. Labs focus on
                                    developing expertise in technology, and
                                    readings supplement lecture discussions on
                                    the human components of education.

                                <blockquote>In this course, we will explore the
                                    use of proof assistants, computer programs
                                    that allow us to write, automate, and
                                    mechanically check proofs. These tools have
                                    two main uses. They allow us to prove
                                    properties of our programs, thereby
                                    guaranteeing that our code is free of
                                    software errors. They also allow us to
                                    formalize mathematics, stating and proving
                                    mathematical theorems in a manner that
                                    leaves no doubt as to their meaning or
                                    veracity. At the intersection of these two
                                    uses lies mechanized computer science,
                                    involving proofs about data structures,
                                    algorithms, programming languages and
                                    verification itself. </blockquote>

                                    principles and practice of computer
                                    security. It aims to teach how to model
                                    threats to computer systems and how to think
                                    like a potential attacker. It presents
                                    standard cryptographic functions and
                                    protocols and gives an overview of threats
                                    and defenses for software, host systems,
                                    networks, and the Web. It also touches on
                                    some of the legal, policy, and ethical
                                    issues surrounding computer security in

                                    goal of this course is to provide a
                                    foundation for further study in computer
                                    security and to help better understand how

                                <blockquote>Cloud computing has become the
                                    primary means for large-scale computation
                                    and services to be delivered. This class
                                    covers a wide range of cloud software
                                    elements that both underpin and shape the
                                    design of scalable internet data services.
                                    The success of cloud computing depends on
                                    efficient resource sharing and application
                                    isolation -- typically supported by virtual
                                    machines (VMs) and containers, controlled by
                                    orchestration infrastructures such as VMWare
                                    and Kubernetes. We will cover these models,
                                    and the oversubscription resource management
                                    approaches that sustain them, as well as the
                                    sustainability and carbon-emission
                                    challenges that limit them. Newer
                                    application architectures such as
                                    micro-services and function-as-a-service
                                    (FaaS or Serverless) enable easy application
                                    design evolution. We will cover these models
                                    and the challenges they present for
                                    implementation. These software structures
                                    support "big data" applications, including
                                    analytical systems such as map-reduce and
                                    Spark. They also include data serving

                                <blockquote>Deep learning is emerging as a major
                                    technique for solving problems in
                                    a variety of fields, including computer
                                    vision, personalized medicine,
                                    autonomous vehicles, and natural language
                                    processing. Critical to
                                    success in these target domains is the
                                    development of learning
                                    systems: deep learning frameworks that
                                    support the tasks of learning
                                    complex models and inferencing with those
                                    models, and targeting many
                                    devices including CPUs, GPUs, mobile device,
                                    edge devices, computer
                                    clusters, and scalable parallel systems. The
                                    systematic study of how
                                    to build and optimize such systems is an
                                    active area of research. This
                                    course is aimed as an introduction to this
                                    topic. We will cover
                                    various aspects of deep learning systems,
                                    including: basics of deep
                                    learning, programming models for expressing
                                    machine learning models,
                                    automatic differentiation methods used to
                                    compute gradients for
                                    training, memory optimization, scheduling,
                                    data and model parallel and
                                    distributed learning, hardware acceleration,
                                    domain specific
                                    languages, workflows for large-scale machine
                                    learning including hyper
                                    parameter optimization and uncertainty
                                    quantification, and training
                                    data and model serving. Many of these topics
                                    intersect with existing
                                    research directions in databases, systems
                                    and networking,
                                    architecture, and programming languages. The
                                    goal is to present a
                                    comprehensive picture of how current deep
                                    learning systems work,
                                    discuss and explore research opportunities
                                    for extending and building
                                    on existing frameworks, and deep dive into
                                    the accelerators being
                                    developed by numerous startups to address
                                    the performance needs of the
                                    machine learning community. We will split
                                    our time between concepts
                                    and practice, with a typical week having one
                                    lecture on a specific
                                    aspect of deep learning systems and one
                                    lab/discussion session in
                                    which technologies such as Keras,
                                    Tensorflow, CNTK, Mxnet, and PyTorch
                                    are used to address that specific aspect.
                                    Some guest lectures may
                                    cover emerging computer architectures for
                                    next-generation deep
                                    learning accelerators. // Note: This course
                                    will provide useful
                                    background for students wishing to take our
                                    Spring 2019 class on

                                <blockquote>In this course, students with little
                                    prior exposure to rigorous mathematical
                                    reasoning gain experience in approaching
                                    mathematical questions, developing concepts,
                                    formalizing ideas, and turning intuition
                                    into rigorous proof. These phases of
                                    mathematical thinking are illustrated on a
                                    variety of accessible and useful topics.
                                    Students practice the quantifier notation
                                    both as a shorthand and as one of the
                                    organizing principles of formal statements.
                                    New concepts are built from such basic
                                    mathematical primitives as numbers, sets,
                                    and functions. Basic counting is a recurring
                                    theme and provides a source for sequences,
                                    another recurring theme, which in turn feeds
                                    into the study of asymptotic behavior (rates
                                    of growth). Further topics to be covered
                                    include proof by induction; the
                                    elements of number theory (gcd, congruences,
                                    the Chinese Remainder Theorem, Fermat's
                                    little Theorem); recurrences, Fibonacci
                                    numbers, generating functions; the elements
                                    of graph theory (trees, paths and cycle,
                                    chromatic number, independent sets and
                                    cliques, connectivity, planarity, directed
                                    graphs), finite probability spaces, random
                                    variables, expected value and variance,
                                    independence, concentration inequalities,
                                    and random graphs. (Please be advised that
                                    this course does not cover linear algebra.)

                                    are NP-hard, and so they are unlikely to
                                    have efficient algorithms that solve them
                                    exactly. Approximation algorithms provide a
                                    way to get around this intractability and to
                                    still efficiently obtain solutions that,
                                    while not being optimal, are close to
                                    optimal. There are however many other
                                    settings in which approximation algorithms
                                    may be desirable. For example, the running
                                    time of the algorithm or its simplicity may
                                    be more important in some settings than
                                    obtaining the best possible solution. Some
                                    other setting, such as streaming algorithms
                                    and sublinear algorithms also naturally lead
                                    to approximation. // The main focus of this
                                    course is on the design of approximation
                                    algorithms for combinatorial optimization
                                    problems. On the one hand, we will cover
                                    central tools and methods that are used in
                                    the design of approximation algorithms (and
                                    beyond). On the other hand, we will explore
                                    central combinatorial optimization problems
                                    that are used as building blocks in many
                                    different algorithms, in a variety of
                                    settings. // Much of this course is
                                    dedicated to approximation algorithms for
                                    NP-hard problems. Time permitting, we will
                                    also explore some additional settings where
                                    approximation takes place (such as very fast
                                    algorithms, streaming and/or sublinear
                                    algorithms). We will also explore the
                                    question of why some problems have good
                                    approximation algorithms while other do not,
                                    via hardness of approximation, or
                                    inapproximability, proofs. // Assumes the

                                        What is the role of randomness in
                                        computing? Algorithm designers often
                                        introduce random choices into their
                                        algorithms in an effort to solve
                                        problems as efficiently as possible.
                                        This is a powerful and valuable
                                        paradigm, but it raises the question,
                                        where are we supposed to get random bits
                                        so that we can run these algorithms? In
                                        this course, we will think of randomness
                                        as an "expensive" or "scarce"
                                        computational resource. All else being
                                        equal, an algorithm that uses fewer
                                        random bits is better than an algorithm
                                        that uses more random bits, just like a
                                        faster algorithm is better than a slower
                                        algorithm. With this motivation, we will
                                        study pseudorandomness, i.e., we will
                                        study objects that appear more random
                                        than they actually are. We will mainly
                                        focus on the theory of unconditional
                                        pseudorandom generators, which use a
                                        small truly random "seed" to generate a
                                        long sequence of bits that appear random
                                        to any "sufficiently efficient"
                                        observer. Other topics will include
                                        randomness extractors, the
                                        derandomization of algorithms, and
                                        expander graphs.</blockquote>

                                    implementation. Algorithmic questions
                                    include sorting and searching, discrete
                                    optimization, algorithmic graph theory,
                                    algorithmic number theory, and cryptography.
                                    Design techniques include divide-and-conquer
                                    methods, dynamic programming, greedy
                                    algorithms, and graph search, as well as the
                                    design of efficient data structures. Methods
                                    of algorithm analysis include asymptotic
                                    notation, evaluation of recurrent
                                    inequalities, the concepts of

                                    algorithms to protect information from
                                    adversaries. Though its origins are ancient,
                                    cryptography now underlies everyday
                                    technologies including the Internet, wifi,
                                    cell phones, payment systems, and more. This
                                    course is an introduction to the design and
                                    analysis of cryptography, including how
                                    “security” is defined, how practical
                                    cryptographic algorithms work, and how to
                                    exploit flaws in cryptography. The course
                                    will cover algorithms for symmetric-key and
                                    public-key encryption, authentication,

                                    scientists, designers, and researchers to
                                    prototype and experiment with future user
                                    interfaces that can dynamically move and
                                    shape-change. This class offers hands-on
                                    experience in learning and employing
                                    actuated and shape-changing user interface
                                    technologies to build interactive user
                                    experiences. The class provides a range of
                                    basic engineering techniques to allow
                                    students to develop their own actuated user
                                    interface systems, including 3D mechanical
                                    design, digital fabrication (e.g. 3D
                                    Printing), electronics (Arduino
                                    microcontroller), and actuator control
                                    (utilizing different kinds of motors).
                                    Through multiple project-based assignments,
                                    students practice the acquired techniques to
                                    build interactive tangible experiences of
                                    their own. </blockquote>

                                <blockquote>The field of human-robot interaction
                                    (HRI) is a new and growing field of research
                                    that explores the interface between people
                                    and robots. Applications of HRI research
                                    include developing robots to tutor
                                    elementary school students, assist human
                                    workers in manufacturing contexts, provide
                                    museum tours, interact with families within
                                    their homes, and help care for the elderly.
                                    The field of HRI is highly
                                    interdisciplinary, incorporating methods and
                                    techniques from human-computer interaction,
                                    robotics, psychology, artificial
                                    intelligence, and other fields. This course
                                    exposes students to a broad range of recent
                                    and cutting-edge research in HRI. The topics
                                    covered in this course include: nonverbal
                                    robot behavior, verbal robot behavior,
                                    social dynamics, norms and ethics,
                                    collaboration and learning, group
                                    interactions, applications, and future
                                    challenges of HRI. Course meetings will
                                    involve students in the class leading
                                    discussions about cutting-edge peer-reviewed
                                    research HRI publications. Throughout the
                                    quarter, teams of students in the course
                                    will also complete an HRI course project of
                                    their choosing where they will investigate
                                    an HRI research question of interest to
                                    them.</blockquote>

                                        We are collecting and storing more data
                                        than ever, and in many domains, data is
                                        growing faster than the available
                                        computational resources. This course
                                        starts with the premise that expecting
                                        exact computation is unsustainable, and
                                        approximation is increasingly necessary.
                                        We will deep dive into both the theory
                                        and the practice of approximate,
                                        randomized, and encoded data structures.

                                        the interface between machine learning
                                        and game theory. In many economic or
                                        game-theoretic applications, the problem
                                        is too complex to be modeled or solved
                                        analytically. In such cases, machine
                                        learning techniques helps to design more
                                        realistic or practical algorithms.
                                        Conversely, in many applications of
                                        machine learning or prediction, the
                                        algorithms have to obtain data from
                                        self-interested agents whose objectives
                                        are not aligned with the algorithm
                                        designer. In those settings, the
                                        algorithms have to take into account
                                        these agents' strategic behaviors. These
                                        problems form an intriguing interplay

                                    of software, and thus play a key role in
                                    computing. This is a foundational course
                                    exploring the principles and concepts
                                    underlying the design and operation of
                                    programming languages. We use a formal
                                    approach based on operational semantics to
                                    give clear and precise descriptions of
                                    language concepts, such as flow of control,
                                    data structures and types, modularity and
                                    abstraction, and concurrency. The major
                                    paradigms of imperative, functional, and
                                    object-oriented paradigms will be covered,
                                    starting with the functional paradigm
                                    because of its simplicity. Programming

                                    innovation in computer architecture is a key
                                    enabler. Residing in the middle of the
                                    system design layers, computer architecture
                                    interacts with both the software stack

                                    and hardware technologies (e.g., logic
                                    gates, interconnects, and memories) to

                                    principles, techniques, and tradeoffs in
                                    designing the hardware/software interface
                                    and hardware components to create a

                                    (2) use KICAD to build circuit schematics;
                                    (3) learn how to wire analog/digital sensors
                                    or actuators to our microcontroller,
                                    including SPI and I2C protocols; (4) use
                                    KICAD to build PCB schematics; (5) actually
                                    manufacture our designs; (6) receive in our

                                    systems. Tensions often arise between a
                                    computer system's utility and its
                                    privacy-invasiveness, between its robustness
                                    and its flexibility, and between its ability
                                    to leverage existing data and existing
                                    data's tendency to encode biases. The course
                                    will demonstrate how computer systems can
                                    violate individuals' privacy and agency,
                                    impact sub-populations in disparate ways,
                                    and harm both society and the environment.
                                    It will also introduce algorithmic

                                    programming assignments and projects,
                                    students will design and implement computer

                                    by design. They will also wrestle with
                                    fundamental questions about who bears
                                    responsibility for a system's shortcomings,
                                    how to balance different stakeholders'
                                    goals, and what societal values computer
                                    systems should embed.</blockquote>

                                    emphasis on ideas rather than on
                                    implementation. Algorithmic questions
                                    include sorting and searching, discrete
                                    optimization, algorithmic graph theory,
                                    algorithmic number theory, and cryptography.
                                    Design techniques include divide-and-conquer
                                    methods, dynamic programming, greedy

                                    design of efficient data structures. Methods
                                    of algorithm analysis include asymptotic
                                    notation, evaluation of recurrent
                                    inequalities, the concepts of
                                    polynomial-time algorithms, and

                                    computer scientists. This class is meant to
                                    introduce computer science students to basic
                                    ideas and techniques for effective

                                    several complementary components, including
                                    critical analysis of technical papers,
                                    weekly writing assignments focusing on
                                    writing style, clarity, and logical flow,
                                    and discussions of style for different
                                    research areas and venues. Later weeks will
                                    focus on skills for effective technical
                                    presentations in different settings, e.g.
                                    conference presentations, job talks, and
                                    keynotes. The course is primarily targeted
                                    towards graduates students, although
                                    undergraduates can audit the class (or

                                    (2) use KICAD to build circuit schematics;
                                    (3) learn how to wire analog/digital sensors
                                    or actuators to our microcontroller,
                                    including SPI and I2C protocols; (4) use

                                    database design and implementation. Topics
                                    include DBMS architecture,
                                    entity-relationship and relational models,
                                    relational algebra, concurrency control,
                                    recovery, indexing, physical data
                                    organization, and modern database systems.
                                    The lab section guides students through the
                                    implementation of a relational database
                                    management system, allowing students to see
                                    topics such as physical data organization
                                    and DBMS architecture in practice, and
                                    exercise general skills such as software
                                    systems development.

                                <blockquote>While data and artificial
                                    intelligence are driving many changes to our
                                    economic, social, political, financial, and
                                    legal systems, we know little about their
                                    foundations and governing dynamics. While
                                    the recombination and integration of diverse
                                    data creates vast new value, we currently
                                    have neither theory for how data can be
                                    combined nor an industrial policy for how to
                                    protect against the personal exposures and
                                    abuses that grow in proportion. Many of
                                    these issues call for treating data as a
                                    first-class citizen and thinking of it as an
                                    asset. What is the value of data, and how do
                                    we measure it? This course explores these
                                    questions from a multidisciplinary
                                    perspective that includes computer science,
                                    economy, social science, among others. The
                                    sessions are organized around broad themes
                                    related to the value of data. A typical
                                    session will consist of a short introduction
                                    by the instructor, followed by a paper
                                    discussion (students are expected to read
                                    the assigned papers ahead of the class), and
                                    finishing with a discussion about individual
                                    projects. // The course can be taken
                                    pass-fail or for a letter grade. For a
                                    letter grade, you need to complete an
                                    individual, quarter-long project. You also
                                    need to attend classes, participate in
                                    discussions, and scribe for two/three
                                    classes. For pass-fail, you do not need to
                                    complete the individual project but all
                                    other requirements apply.</blockquote>

                                    introduces fundamental techniques related to
                                    data acquisition, data cleaning, sampling,
                                    statistical modeling, experimental design,
                                    feature engineering, and modeling with
                                    machine learning. It then explores the
                                    problems that arise in different ways of
                                    performing those tasks, the fairness and
                                    bias of machine learning models, data
                                    visualizations, and user interfaces. In
                                    addition, the course covers anonymization
                                    and deanonymization, conceptions of privacy
                                    from a number of perspectives (statistical,
                                    legal, and philosophical), and compliance
                                    with contractual or legal requirements
                                    around data. The course concludes by
                                    discussing current controversies around the
                                    use and misuse of data. Through both
                                    programming assignments and discussions,
                                    students who complete the course will learn
                                    how to design systems that are inclusive and
                                    respectful of all data subjects.

                                <blockquote>Many problems in machine learning,
                                    computer vision, natural language
                                    processing, robotics, computational biology,
                                    and beyond require modeling complex
                                    interactions between large, heterogeneous
                                    collections of random variables. Graphical
                                    models combine probability theory and graph
                                    theory to provide a unifying framework for
                                    representing these relationships in a
                                    compact, structured form. Probabilistic
                                    graphical models decompose multivariate
                                    joint distributions into a set of local
                                    relationships among small subsets of random
                                    variables via a graph. These local
                                    interactions result in conditional
                                    independencies that afford efficient
                                    learning and inference algorithms. Moreover,
                                    their modular structure provides an
                                    intuitive language for expressing
                                    domain-specific knowledge, and facilitates
                                    the transfer of modeling advances to new
                                    applications. // This graduate-level course
                                    will provide a strong foundation for
                                    learning and inference with probabilistic
                                    graphical models. The course will first
                                    introduce the underlying representational
                                    power of graphical models, including
                                    Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic
                                    Bayesian networks. Next, the course will
                                    investigate contemporary approaches to
                                    statistical inference, both exact and
                                    approximate. The course will then survey
                                    state-of-the-art methods for learning the
                                    structure and parameters of graphical
